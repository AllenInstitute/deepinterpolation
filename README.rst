# **Deep Interpolation**


*deepinterpolation* is a Python library to denoise data by removing independent noise. Importantly training does **NOT** require ground truth. This repository is currently meant to support the bioRxiv publication results : https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.15.341602v1

**Figure 1** - Schematic introducing the principles of deep interpolation.  **A**. An interpolation model is trained to predict a noisy block from other blocks with independent noise. The loss is the difference between the predicted data and a new noisy block. **B**. The interpolation model is used to create a noiseless version of the input data. 

For more information, consult the associated bioRxiv publication : https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.15.341602v1


# **Support**

For bug and issues, please submit issue tickets on this repository. For installation and running support, we are trying to move to using the more public discussion forum on this repository (https://github.com/AllenInstitute/deepinterpolation/discussions). Alternatively you can join the slack channel where the past support history was saved (if invitation has expired: email to Jerome): https://join.slack.com/t/deepinterpolation/shared_invite/zt-rkmcw7h1-v8y0Grwe3fZg4m~DiAQVMg

# **Installation**

In all cases, unless you only want to work from CPU, you will have to consider installing tensorflow GPU dependencies (ie. cuda drivers). To that end, you might have to consult tensorflow documentation to enable your GPU. 

To install the package, you have 2 options. 

1. Install from pypi using: 

Create new conda environment called 'local_env'

	conda create -n local_env python=3.7
    
Our integration tests on the CI server are currently running with python 3.7. While it is likely working with other versions, we cannot guarantee it. 

	pip install deepinterpolation

This will install the latest deployed stable version and only the core components of the library. You will NOT have access to sample datasets present on this repository. 

2. Install from a clone of this repository. 

This will give you access to the latest developments as well as the provided sample data. Our step by step example assume this installation mode as it depends on the sample datasets. 

The small training examples below works on both CPU and GPU architecture (ie. even a small macbook). If you are not familiar with using deep learning, we recommend to play with smaller datasets first, such as the example Neuropixel data provided. 

* Clone the repository locally on a directory 'local_dir'

	git clone https://github.com/AllenInstitute/deepinterpolation.git

* Go to that directory

	cd 'local_dir'

* Create new conda environment called 'local_env'

	conda create -n local_env python=3.7

Our integration tests on the CI server are currently running with python 3.7. While it is likely working with other versions, we cannot guarantee it. 

* activate environment

	conda activate local_env

* install necessary packages

	make init

* install deepinterpolation package

	python setup.py install

# **General package description**

The files in the deepinterpolation folder contain the core classes for training, inference, loss calculation and network generations. Those are called 'Collection'. Each collection is essentially a local list of functions that are used to create different type of objects and can be extended on one another. 
For instance, the network_collection.py contains a list of networks that can be generated for training. This allows for quick iteration and modification of an architecture while keeping the code organized. 

# **FAQ**

# **Example training**

To try out training your own DeepInterpolation network, we recommend to start with this file: https://github.com/AllenInstitute/deepinterpolation/blob/master/examples/example_tiny_ephys_training.py

In this file, you will need to edit the paths to a local folder appropriate to save your models. 

Then, activate your conda env called 'local_env'

	conda activate local_env
	
then run

	python example_tiny_ephys_training.py

If everything runs correctly, you should see the following in just a few minutes :

	Saved model to disk

This is a toy example but you can increase the number of training frames to increase the quality of the model. 
All parameters are commented in the file. To adjust to a larger dataset, change the path parameters, the start_frame and end_frame parameters.
Please consult the annotated example for more details of each parameter.

To start inference, we recommend to start with this file: https://github.com/AllenInstitute/deepinterpolation/blob/master/examples/example_tiny_ephys_inference.py

In this file, you will need to edit the paths strings to fit your local paths. 

Then, activate your conda env called 'local_env'

	conda activate local_env
	
then run:

	python example_tiny_ephys_inference.py

If everything runs correctly, you should see the following in just a few minutes:

	2020-10-20 14:10:37.549061: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:142] This TensorFlow binary is optimized with oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN)to use the following CPU instructions in performance-critical operations:  AVX2 FMA
	To enable them in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.
	sh: sysctl: command not found
	2020-10-20 14:10:37.564133: I tensorflow/compiler/xla/service/service.cc:168] XLA service 0x7f82ada8a520 initialized for platform Host (this does not guarantee that XLA will be used). Devices:
	2020-10-20 14:10:37.564156: I tensorflow/compiler/xla/service/service.cc:176]   StreamExecutor device (0): Host, Default Version

This is a toy example but you can increase the start_frame and end_frame variable for larger data. 

It is important to keep in mind that this process is easily parallelizable. In practice, we wrapped this code with additional routines to leverage 20 to 100 cluster CPU nodes to accelerate this process. You could also use GPU nodes as well, we just had access to a much larger number of CPU machines quickly.  

# **Adapting the module to a newer data structure**

To adapt DeepInterpolation to a new dataset, you will need to use or recreate a generator in 'generator_collection.py'. Those are all constructed from core classes called *DeepGenerator* and *SequentialGenerator*. 

The *CollectorGenerator* class allows to group generators if your dataset is distributed across many files/folder/sources. 
This system was designed to allow to train very large DeepInterpolation models from TB of data distributed on a network infrastructure.
